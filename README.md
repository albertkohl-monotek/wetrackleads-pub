# We Track Leads

**We Track Leads** helps businesses understand where their customers are coming from and how well their marketing is working.

Whether someone calls your business, fills out a form on your website, or visits your landing page, We Track Leads shows you exactly which marketing efforts are bringing in results. You'll get instant notifications when new leads come in, see detailed reports on what's working (and what's not), and understand which ads, campaigns, or regions are generating the most business.

Think of it as a GPS for your marketing dollars â€“ instead of guessing which advertising brings customers through your door, you'll know for certain. The service tracks phone calls, website visitors, and online inquiries, then organizes everything into easy-to-understand reports so you can invest more in what works and stop wasting money on what doesn't.
